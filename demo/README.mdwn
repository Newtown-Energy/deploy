# Demo

This is a demo setup. It demonstrates pulling fields from a bitwarden
item, passing them to ansible, then on into a docker container on the
remote side.  We're trying to avoid writing these to disk.

The big downside to this structure is that systemd doesn't have access
to these values.  When we want to run the container on the remote, we
*must* do so via ansible from the local side, with the local user
having access to an unlocked bw session.  This allows for unattended
automatic docker-compose restarts but makes unattended reboots
impossible.

To use this demo, `adosh bromine.newtown push`, then `adosh bromine.newtown deploy`.

To adapt for your use, copy `deploy.yml` and `docker-compose.yml`, and
then set vaultid in the deploy.yml file.
