# Newtown Deploy

Each directory is an app or service we might deploy somewhere.

The convention is to use /opt/servicename on the remote for whatever we need.

Each service should have sufficient scripts and instructions to support its
deploy.

Please don't put and secrets or configuration in git.  I am working on
solutions for those.
