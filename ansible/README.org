* Ansible

We are using ansible for remote administration.  Generally, we can
load a script and then run it.  This is often preferable to doing
every command as an ansible command, which is slow, cumbersome to
write, and hard to parse for a dev.

The things we'll need to nail are:

 * Firewalls
 * Tailscale or tinc
 * System updates
